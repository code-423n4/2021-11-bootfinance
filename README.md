# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.


The `contracts_tree.txt` contains a list of contracts in the scope, their sLOC and a brief one-liner of their function.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Provide contest details

## üë¢ Introduction

Boot Finance is a project focused AMM that aims to let projects control their own liquidity, with the eventual goal of being the primary AMM/DEX for the majority of projects in DeFi.

As the majority of DeFi infrastructure moves to L2s over the coming months/years, the existing DEX/AMM ecosystem will be disrupted.
It‚Äôs the thesis of Boot Finance that the current AMM dex landscape with one-size fits all solutions cannot persist as projects move to L2s. As gas costs reduce, there is reduced need for massive single source liquidity pools(the main competitive metric right now in DEXes), as arb bots can inexpensively arb the price across multiple liquidity sources. Many projects will want both the advantages of custom AMMs that provide features/parameters that are governed by the project itself, along with the ability to manage their LP positions in traditional DEXes across the entire EVM L2 landscape.

Boot Finance introduces the novel [CustomSwap](https://blog.boot.finance/customswap-by-boot-finance-1336f6d63cbd) algorithm that allows projects to more granularly control their price movements, and avoid sudden liquidity shocks.

  | - tge
  |  | - contracts                                <Contracts from Vether(vetherasset.io) Code Base; modified to enable NFT-gated TGE>
  |  |  | - PublicSale.sol                        [314]	#TGE Contract - Based on Vether4.sol from VetherAsset codebase
  |  |  | - PublicSaleBatchWithdraw.sol           [40]	#Batch Withdraw - Withdraw tokens for all weeks and days at once
```
The codebase of Boot Finance is a combination of Curve/Swerve/Saddle/Vether codebases, with native pools borrowing from Curve/Swerve, CustomSwap Pools relying on Saddle, and Vether being utilized for TGE.

The Curve/Swerve code-bases have had multiple audits and hence are excluded from the scope of this specific audit, but are included for reference to how the larger set-up works.

All emissions are in line with the standard [token emission schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16aZznOquMsZnx1nz31RQQ6gtMfxiiSuSrVDA19srbBs/edit#gid=1421541501).

#### üìÑ Swap.sol [697]
This is the main swap contract from Saddle codebase that relies on Math and Swap Utils libraries. The swap logic has been modified to allow pricing with the use of multiple curves instead of a singular price curve. At a `targetprice` the curve being used switches, this allows flexibility to choose multiple A factors that can be in effect depending on the price. ie use A = X at price < Z, use A = Y at price > Z.

#### üìÑ AirdropDistribution.sol [611]
10% of all $BOOT DAO tokens will be distributed to Swerve Active Governance Participants based on a snapshot taken earlier, this contract handles the distribution of tokens for airdrop eligible participants.

#### üìÑ InvestorDistribution.sol [218]
Boot had a small angel, and then a seed round. The distribution for that allocation is handled by this contract.

#### üìÑ Vesting.sol [216]
All boot emissions, regardless of entity are subject to a standard 12-month vesting for 70% of their eligible tokens, ie. LP claims X tokens 30% is instantly transferred out, 70% is locked on their behalf in the vesting contract which can be claimed linearly over the next 12 months.

#### üìÑ PublicSale.sol [314]
TGE for distribution of public allocation based on [Vether](https://www.vetherasset.io). For the first four weeks, only NFT holders can participate in the public TGE.

# Contest prep

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Designate someone (or a team of people) to monitor DMs & questions in the C4 Discord (**#questions** channel) daily (Note: please *don't* discuss issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.
